       But basically,
       <View> lets you render multiple 3D scenes (or multiple views of the same scene) inside a single <Canvas>, using different HTML containers.
       
       Think of a Canvas as your camera control room, and each View as a different monitor showing a different angle or scene â€” but all controlled from the same place.
