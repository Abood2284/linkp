I'll help you update this analytics service to match our new optimized schema design. Looking at the code, this service was using a simple `workspaceAnalytics` table to track basic page views. Our new schema is much more robust with `linkEvents`, `aggregatedMetrics`, and `realtimeMetrics` tables.

Let's refactor this service to take advantage of our new analytics system:

Key Changes and Improvements:

1. **More Comprehensive Data Collection**
   - Now tracking detailed visitor information
   - Device and browser detection
   - Geographic data collection
   - Session and visitor tracking

2. **Three-Layer Analytics System**
   - Raw event logging (`linkEvents`)
   - Real-time metrics (`realtimeMetrics`)
   - Aggregated statistics (`aggregatedMetrics`)

3. **New Features**
   - Support for link-specific analytics
   - Real-time visitor counting
   - Better session tracking
   - Geographic data collection
   - Device and browser analytics

4. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Separating real-time from historical data
   - Using background jobs for aggregations
   - Efficient database operations

You'll need to implement a few supporting functions:

1. `getGeoData()` - For getting visitor geographic information:
```typescript
// lib/geo.ts
import { getClientIpAddress } from './ip';

export async function getGeoData() {
  try {
    const ip = await getClientIpAddress();
    // Use a geo-IP service (MaxMind, IP-API, etc.)
    // Return { country, city, region }
  } catch {
    return null;
  }
}
```

2. Background Job for Aggregation:
```typescript
// jobs/aggregate-metrics.ts
export async function aggregateMetrics(workspaceId: string) {
  // Aggregate metrics for different time buckets
  // This should run on a schedule (e.g., every hour)
  await aggregateTimeframe(workspaceId, 'hour');
  await aggregateTimeframe(workspaceId, 'day');
  await aggregateTimeframe(workspaceId, 'week');
  await aggregateTimeframe(workspaceId, 'month');
}
```

The changes make the analytics service:
1. More scalable (separating concerns)
2. More detailed (collecting more data)
3. More performant (using proper indexing and aggregation)
4. More useful (providing real-time insights)

Would you like me to:
1. Provide the implementation for the background jobs?
2. Show how to integrate this with a queueing system?
3. Create the geo-location service implementation?

Let me know what aspect you'd like to explore further!
