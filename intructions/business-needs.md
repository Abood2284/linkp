Business Users are users with business accounts.

Step 1: Understand the Business Userâ€™s Needs
Business users (brands) will use your platform to:

- Discover creators who align with their target audience.

- Send promotional proposals to creators.

- Track campaign performance (e.g., clicks, conversions, ROI).

- Manage budgets and payments for campaigns.

- Build relationships with creators for long-term collaborations.

To support these needs, we need to design features and data structures that make it easy for businesses to:

- Find the right creators.

- Create and manage campaigns.

- Analyze performance.

- Pay creators seamlessly.
