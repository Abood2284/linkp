# Analytics System Rules

- Analytics is powered by PostHog (client-side) and custom aggregation jobs (server-side).
- Events tracked: `workspace_page_view`, `workspace_link_click` ([analytics-working.md](mdc:analytics-working.md)).
- Use `linkEvents` for raw events, `aggregatedMetrics` for time-bucketed stats, and `realtimeMetrics` for live dashboards ([analytics-future-working.md](mdc:analytics-future-working.md)).
- All analytics endpoints and dashboard logic should follow the event/aggregation separation.
- Use consistent event naming, include timestamps, and collect all relevant context.
- For future analytics plans and optimizations, see [analytics-future-working.md](mdc:analytics-future-working.md).
