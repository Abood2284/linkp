# Deployment and CI/CD Rules
- Deployments are managed via GitHub Actions ([github-workflows.md](mdc:github-workflows.md)):
  - PRs trigger preview deploys (with isolated Neon DB branch).
  - Main branch triggers production deploy.
  - PR close triggers cleanup.
- Always update secrets in both GitHub and local `.env` when changing DB URLs.
- Run DB migrations before every deploy.
- Test preview deployments thoroughly before merging; monitor Cloudflare and Neon logs for issues.
- For troubleshooting and workflow details, see [github-workflows.md](mdc:github-workflows.md).
