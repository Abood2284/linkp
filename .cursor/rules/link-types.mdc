# Link Types and Extensibility Rules
- Supported link types: `"social"`, `"regular"`, `"commerce"`, `"booking"` ([future-link-todo.md](mdc:future-link-todo.md)).
- Each link type can have custom config and analytics.
- For new link types, update the enum, analytics, and UI logic together.
- Consider business and feature implications for each link type; see [future-link-todo.md](mdc:future-link-todo.md) for design rationale and expansion ideas.
