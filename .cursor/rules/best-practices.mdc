# Best Practices
- Always use TypeScript interfaces, never type assertions.
- Use early returns and guard clauses for error handling; avoid deeply nested ifs.
- All server actions must use `next-safe-action` and return `ActionResponse`.
- For analytics, use consistent event naming, include timestamps, and collect all relevant context.
- For templates, optimize for edge runtime, mobile-first, and performance.
- For Instagram, handle token refresh and webhook events asynchronously.
- Use content variables for static content, and always test for edge cases and error boundaries.
- Reference the appropriate rule file or readme for detailed guidance on each topic.
