# Instagram Integration Rules
- OAuth, token management, and webhook flows are documented in [how-instagram-api-works.md](mdc:how-instagram-api-works.md).
- All Instagram connection logic is in `apps/linkp-website/app/dashboard/[slug]/instagram/page.tsx` (frontend) and `apps/linkp-worker/src/routes/instagram.ts` (backend).
- Always update redirect URIs in both code and Facebook dashboard when changing environments.
- Store only long-lived tokens; refresh and background sync as described.
- Handle token refresh and webhook events asynchronously.
- Follow security best practices: state parameter verification, secure token storage, webhook validation, and comprehensive error handling.
