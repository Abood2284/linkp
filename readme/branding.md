---

## 1. Brand Strategy

### 1.1. Our Identity

Linkp is the **professional-grade platform** for established creators who are serious about monetization. We are not a toy. We are a tool for building a business. Our brand should always feel intelligent, reliable, and sophisticated.

### 1.2. Competitive Positioning

We are the direct antithesis of playful, generic, or "fun" link-in-bio tools.

-   **vs. Linktree**: They are accessible and for everyone. We are exclusive and for the professional. Their branding is playful; ours is elegant and confident.
-   **Our Stance**: We don't compete on the number of features or templates. We compete on the *quality and effectiveness* of our features. Every pixel is optimized for revenue and brand perception.

### 1.3. Voice & Tone

Our voice is that of a competent, trusted advisor.

-   **Confident & Direct**: "Your Linktree Looks Basic. Your Revenue Shows It."
-   **Aspirational & Benefit-Driven**: "Join creators who get brand partnership offers in their DMs."
-   **Exclusive & Professional**: "Not for new creators. This is for established creators ready to turn their audience into income."

## 5. Visual Style Guide

-   **Layout:** Clean, spacious, with a strong grid system.
-   **Imagery:** High-quality, professional photography. Avoid generic stock photos. Focus on authentic creator content and sophisticated, abstract visuals.
-   **Shadows:** Use subtle, soft shadows to create depth. `shadow-lg` and `shadow-xl` from Tailwind are good starting points, but with brand colors.
-   **Corners:** Use a consistent border-radius. A radius of `16px` for large containers and `8px` for smaller elements like buttons is recommended.

This document will serve as our guide to ensure Linkp presents a consistent, competent, and compelling brand across all touchpoints.
