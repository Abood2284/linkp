## 📱 ADIL'S USER JOURNEY - First 2 Sections

### 1. 🌸 HERO SECTION - "The Elegant Welcome"

**Adil's Experience:**

> "When I visit this website, the theme is whitish, like not white but very light orange or floral something like that. And this big heading with a sexy font in the center of the screen that said 'Welcome to Linkp'. And below that there was a very small text compared to the heading font, that said 'A Tool that helps you create digital link-in-bio'. And below that there was an iPhone 3D model with a link-in-bio template."

#### Visual Design:

- **Background:** Light floral/whitish theme with subtle orange tints
- **Typography:** Large, sexy font for "Welcome to Linkp" (center)
- **Subtitle:** Small, elegant text underneath
- **3D Element:** Single centered iPhone 3D model displaying template

#### 3D Components Needed:

- **Centered iPhone Model**

  - High-quality 3D iPhone displaying premium template
  - Subtle floating animation
  - Elegant lighting setup
  - Perfect center positioning

- **Background Atmosphere**
  - Light floral/whitish gradient background
  - Subtle orange color hints throughout
  - Soft ambient lighting
  - Minimal, clean aesthetic

#### Copy Strategy:

```
Main Headline: "Welcome to Linkp"
Subtitle: "A Tool that helps you create digital link-in-bio"
```

### 2. 🏎️ TEMPLATE SHOWCASE - "The Luxury Platform"

**Adil's Experience:**

> "Upon a little scroll, there was smooth scroll down, which took me to another section, with another bg color. And the texts faded only the 3D model came down rotating and instead of being in the center it came to the left. And it was on a rotating plate, like the ones where you keep a luxury car on, to keep it slowly rotating. And from the template bullet lines were coming out - the ones that comes out from a game, a line that ends with a square telling what this part is. And these bullet points were connected to text talking about the templates feature."

#### Visual Design:

- **Background transition:** New background color from hero
- **Text behavior:** Hero text fades out elegantly
- **iPhone movement:** Rotates while moving from center to left position
- **Luxury platform:** Rotating display base (like car showroom)
- **Game-style UI:** Bullet lines with square endpoints connecting to feature text

#### 3D Components Needed:

- **Cinematic Transition System**

  - Smooth scroll-triggered animation
  - iPhone rotates while moving to left position
  - Background color transition
  - Text fade-out choreography

- **Luxury Rotating Platform**

  - High-end display base (glass/metal/holographic)
  - Slow, elegant rotation speed
  - Realistic reflections and lighting
  - Premium material appearance

- **Game-Style Bullet System**

  - Lines extending from iPhone template elements
  - Square endpoints (game UI style)
  - Smooth animation appearance
  - Connected to explanatory text

- **Interactive Elements**
  - Bullet lines appear progressively
  - Text explanations fade in with connection
  - Hover states for enhanced interactivity

#### Copy Strategy:

```
Section Focus: Template Features Explanation
Bullet Point Topics:
- Template Quality
- Customization Options
- Performance Benefits
- Creator-Focused Design
```

## 🚧 FUTURE SECTIONS (TBD)

### 3. 🤔 Comparison Section 

Use `compare` component from aceternity UI, to compare basic link-in-bio page with your premium link-in-bio page

### 4. 💰 Revenue/Money Section - "TBD"

**Status:** Pending comparison section decision

### 5. 🎯 CTA/Social Proof - "TBD"

**Status:** Pending overall flow finalization

### 6. Changelog Section

Since i am solo developer i will have to use `timeline` component from aceternity UI and show how often changes are released on this app, to gain trust even if only one founder is working on this project
