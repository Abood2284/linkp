### Technical Debt & Improvements Needed

1. Analytics Schema Update Required
   - Need to incorporate Instagram metrics
   - Add promotional link tracking
   - Implement real-time analytics

2. Schema Updates Needed
   - Add promotional link type
   - Instagram integration tables
   - Brand-creator interaction tables
   - Dispute management tables
   - Banned links tables

3. Creator Profile Page Improvements
   - **File Locations**:
     - Frontend: `apps/linkp-website/app/(onboarding)/business/creator/[id]/page.tsx`
     - API: `apps/linkp-worker/src/routes/business.ts`
   - **Current Issues**:
     - Null values in creator profile data (bio, socialProof, promotionRate)
     - Schema-related errors in `business.ts` where code tries to access non-existent properties
     - The aggregatedMetrics table has a 'metrics' JSON field instead of 'count' or 'metricType' fields
   - **Required Improvements**:
     - Update queries in `business.ts` to extract metrics from the JSON 'metrics' field
     - Add feature to display latest/top-performing posts of the creator
     - Implement fallback UI for null values until proper data is available
   - **UI Enhancement Suggestions**:
     - Add engagement metrics visualization (charts/graphs)
     - Implement tabbed interface for different creator information categories
     - Add social proof section with testimonials or brand collaborations
     - Include a media gallery showcasing creator's best work
     - Add direct contact/collaboration request button for businesses

4. On Instagram Connection page `// apps/linkp-website/app/dashboard/[slug]/instagram/page.tsx` when you are not connected, there is a button saying `connect you instagram`. that allows you to connect your instagram account
  - Bug here is, when you press that it asks you to connect to that instagram account which is already logged in. In that browser
  - For me it was asking me to oauth with this instagram accout `dhheudbddddjd` on Arc browser even i didn't wanted to
  - To tackle this, when the dialog appead asking for oauth, there is a 3 dots on the top right of the dialog, click on that and click on `switch account` to switch to your instagram account
  [] Now you will need to create a video explaining all of these on the instagram/page.tsx. Properly explaining how to switch accounts and everything.

### Next Steps
1. Update analytics schema
2. Implement Instagram integration
3. Build creator dashboard
4. Develop brand interface
5. Design dispute resolution system
6. Implement banned links detection
